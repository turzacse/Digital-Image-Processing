# Image Bitwise Operations using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to perform various bitwise operations such as **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, and **NOT** on two images using Python and OpenCV. The images used in this project are `couple.png` and `couple2.png`.

---

## Features:
- Load, display, and resize images.
- Perform bitwise operations: **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, and **NOT**.
- Save the processed images to disk.
- Download processed images when using Google Colab.
