# Image Bitwise Operations using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to perform bitwise operations such as **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, and **NOT** on two images using Python and OpenCV. The images used in this project are `couple.png` and `couple2.png`.

## Features:
- Load and display two images.
- Resize images if necessary to make their dimensions match.
- Perform bitwise operations: **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, and **NOT**.
- Display and save the results of each operation.
- Download processed images if using Google Colab.
